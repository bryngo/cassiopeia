# Cassiopeia

A Python adaptation of the Riot Games League of Legends API (https://developer.riotgames.com/).

Cassiopeia is the sister library to [Orianna](https://github.com/robrua/Orianna) (Java). It's been designed with usability in mind - making sure all the bookkeeping is done right so you can focus on getting the data you need and building your application. There's two main entry points - riotapi and baseriotapi. The former handles a ton of stuff behind the scenes to make your development experience awesome, while the latter allows you fine-grained control by exposing the Riot API exactly as the website's documentation specifies.

## Documentation and Examples
Cassiopeia has detailed [documentation](http://cassiopeia.readthedocs.org/en/v3-development/) and [examples](https://github.com/meraki-analytics/cassiopeia/tree/v3-development/examples).

## Installation
`pip install cassiopeia` or see [here](<http://cassiopeia.readthedocs.io/en/v3-development/setup.html>) for more information.

## Usage

Here's an example of a basic use of the API. The full documentation can be found at http://cassiopeia.readthedocs.org/en/v3-development/.

```python
import random

import cassiopeia as cass

summoner = cass.get_summoner(name="Kalturi")
print("{name} is a level {level} summoner on the {region} server.".format(name=summoner.name,
                                                                          level=summoner.level,
                                                                          region=summoner.region))

champions = cass.get_champions()
random_champion = random.choice(champions)
print("He enjoys playing champions such as {name}.".format(name=random_champion.name))

challenger_league = cass.get_challenger()
best_na = challenger_league[0].summoner
print("He's not as good {name} at League, but probably a better python programmer!".format(name=best_na.name))
```
